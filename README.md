#Length of Stay and Readmission Risk Prediction in Cardiac Patients

#Project overview
This repository contains my progress on my Final Year Project (FYP), which focuses on predicting:
- Length of Stay (LOS)
- Readmission Risk
for Myocardial Infarction (MI) patients using the MIMIC-IV clinical database.

#Current status
- Data extraction and MI cohort definition completed
- Feature engineering completed (admission-time variables only)
- LOS models implemented and evaluated
- Readmission modelling in progress
- Streamlit app, MongoDB integration and Power BI dashboard to be completed in later phases

#Repository contents
- `w1998467_Main.py` – Main data processing and modelling script
- CSV files – Derived datasets used for analysis
- `.vscode/` – Development environment

#Note - 
The data used in this project is derived from the MIMIC-IV database.
These files are included only for academic assessment visibility and public sharing is restricted according to the data usage guidelines.
